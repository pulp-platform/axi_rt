# Contribution Guide

We are happy to accept pull requests and issues from any contributors. Please
note that we try to maintain a consistent quality standard. For a quick overview
please find some of the most important points below.

## Quick Overview

* Keep a clean commit history. This means no merge commits, and no long series
  of "fixup" patches (rebase or squash as appropriate). Structure work as a
  series of logically ordered, atomic patches. `git rebase -i` is your friend.
* Changes should only be made via pull request, with review. A pull request will
  be committed by a "committer" (an account listed in `CODEOWNERS`) once it has
  had an explicit positive review.
* When changes are restricted to a specific area, you are recommended to add a
  tag to the beginning of the first line of the commit message in square
  brackets e.g., "uart: Fix bug #157".
* Areas which are not clear by their name alone (e.g., "vendor") should be
  separated by a slash. For example "hw/vendor: Add patch directory".
* Create pull requests from a fork rather than making new branches in
  `github.com/pulp_platform/axi_rt`.
* Do not force push.
* Do not attempt to commit code with a non-Solderpad license without discussing
  first.
* If a relevant bug or tracking issue exists, reference it in the pull request
  and commits.

## Git Considerations

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 100 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

For further information please see the excellent
[guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams.

## Code Style

Consistent code style is important. We try to follow existing style conventions
as much as possible:

* For RTL we use [lowRISC's SystemVerilog style
  guidelines](https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md).
* For C/C++ we follow [Google's style
  guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), pleas note the
  `clang-format` in the projects root.
* For Python code we follow the official [`pep8` style
  guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* For `yaml` files (such as the `Bender.yml`) we format using `ymlfmt`.
  Unfortunately, we do not know whether an official style guide exists.

Please make sure that any code you submit is adhering to the correct standard.
